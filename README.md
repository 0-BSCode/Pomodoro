# Pomodoro

A task tracker app created with the T3 Stack.

## To-do's

1. Current task selection (when timer starts, only that task is shown)
2. Extra actions for tasks (delete all, clear those completed, reorder tasks, RTE for task description)
3. LOFI music player
4. Quote generator (show only during timer start)
5. Clean up timer logic
6. Settings refactor (input should be easier to edit)
7. UI refactor (desktop design, accent colors, replace image w/ next image)
8. Log out via profile button click
